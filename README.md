# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Introduction
Road accidents represent a serious global concern, resulting in loss of life, injuries, and economic repercussions. Analyzing road accident data is vital for understanding the underlying factors and devising effective prevention strategies. In this report, we delve into a road accident database to uncover patterns, trends, and potential interventions aimed at reducing accidents and enhancing road safety.

## Installation
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Asadi1460/road_accident
  ```

## Usage
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
- Run the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` to perform the analysis.

## Data Description
The road accident database contains the following columns:
- Status
- Accident_Index
- Accident_Year
- Accident_Reference
- Vehicle_Reference
- Casualty_Reference
- Casualty_Class
- Sex_of_Casualty
- Age_of_Casualty
- Age_Band_of_Casualty
- Casualty_Severity
- Pedestrian_Location
- Pedestrian_Movement
- Car_Passenger
- Bus_or_Coach_Passenger
- Pedestrian_Road_Maintenance_Worker
- Casualty_Type
- Casualty_Home_Area_Type
- Casualty_IMD_Decile
- LSOA_of_Casualty

## Analysis Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

## Results
- The analysis reveals insights into accident patterns, trends, and factors contributing to accident severity.
Our analysis yields several key findings:
- The majority of accidents are reported as slight, followed by serious and fatal.
- Male individuals are more frequently implicated in traffic accidents compared to their female counterparts.
- Most of the traffic accidents happened in urban areas
- Individuals who experienced more severe accidents tend to be older compared to those involved in less severe incidents.
- Certain factors such as  IMD decile  exhibit significant correlations with accident frequency and severity.
- Machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are utilized to predict accident severity with varying degrees of accuracy.

## Discussion
- The analysis highlights the complexity of road accidents and the necessity of a multifaceted approach to road safety. Collaboration among government agencies, law enforcement, transportation authorities, and community organizations is essential to address factors like driver behavior, infrastructure deficiencies, and socio-economic disparities. Targeted interventions such as education campaigns, improved road design, and stricter enforcement of traffic laws can effectively mitigate accident risks. While machine learning models offer promise in predicting accident severity, ongoing research is required to refine their accuracy. The findings stress the importance of tailored interventions targeting specific risk factors identified in the analysis. Overall, analyzing road accident data offers valuable insights for developing effective prevention strategies and fostering safer road environments for all. This report lays the groundwork for further research and policy initiatives in road safety and accident prevention.

## Suggestions
- Based on our analysis, we recommend the following strategies to reduce traffic accidents:
1.	Implement comprehensive road safety education programs targeting drivers, pedestrians, and vulnerable road users.
2.	Invest in infrastructure improvements, including better signage, lighting, and pedestrian crossings, to enhance safety for all road users.
3.	Enforce stricter regulations on speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving to deter risky behavior and promote responsible driving.
4.	Increase funding for road maintenance and repair to address infrastructure deficiencies and reduce accident risks.
5.	Collaborate with local communities and stakeholders to address socio-economic disparities and improve access to safe transportation options.
By implementing these recommendations, policymakers and stakeholders can work towards creating safer roads and reducing the human and economic toll of traffic accidents.

Overall, the analysis of the road accident database provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to accidents and casualties, informing evidence-based strategies for improving road safety and saving lives.
